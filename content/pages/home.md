I am a Digital Design Lead with experience leading the best teams in London and Hong Kong. Putting my clients' users first allows me to have a clear vision, informed by business goals and brand values.

I create flow maps and high fidelity prototypes that inform you making better decisions about your product and your market. If you simply want to test a particular feature or if you want the complete package, including branding, illustration, world-class typography and user-friendly UX, I help out with testable, validated designs.
