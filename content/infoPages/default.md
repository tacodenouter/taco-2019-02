## Hello!

I'm a digital design lead with experience leading teams in London and Hong Kong.

### Now

We live in exciting times when it comes to digital design. Startups are devising design systems, design tools are getting better and better and design thinking permeates every successful, forward-thinking business. Our digital lives are changing by the minute and I am glad to be working with [people who are at the forefront](https://chengbao.com.hk/).

### Before

I studied illustration at Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam. I spent some time in Los Angeles where I studied fine art. Soon after graduating I moved to London where I learned branding and design from some the best in the business. I got the startup bug and worked for a number of tech companies.

I am a designer first, team lead second, illustrator third and a hobby dev last.
