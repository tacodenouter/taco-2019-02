## Hello!

I'm a digital design lead with experience leading teams in London and Hong Kong.

Just like you, I'm lucky to live in these exciting times when it comes to digital design. Startups are devising design systems, design tools are getting better and better and design thinking permeates all kinds of businesses. Our digital lives in general are changing by the minute and I am glad to be working with [people who are at the forefront](https://chengbao.com.hk/).

### Studies & work

I studied illustration at Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I spent some time in Los Angeles, USA where I studied fine art. Soon after graduating I moved to London, UK where I learned design and branding from some the best in the business. I started working for a number of tech startups in the first half of the 2010s and two years ago I moved to Hong Kong.

I am a digital product designer first, a design lead second and maybe an illustrator third.
