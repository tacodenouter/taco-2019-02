## Chengbao
With Chengbao I'm working with the industry's finest digital designers to create a global platform of ground-breaking software.


## Fitch
Fitch is the world's leading branding and retail design studio with offices across the world.

I led the design team, covering all UI and UX design output for their digital clients. Together we create some of Hong Kong's best digital work for the region's most forward thinking clients in the retail and member's club space.

## Hi Mum! Said Dad
Hi Mum! Said Dad is a full service digital agency focusing on designing and developing iOS and Android apps, but extending to CRM and payment platforms. Clients include The National Trust, Good Energy, Carling and a number of smaller businesses and startups.

I managed a team of talented designers, covering all visual and UX design output and I worked closely with strategy and development teams, generating new business and maintaining relationships with existing clients.

## Kindeo
Kindeo is an autobiographical storytelling iPad and web app aiming to let user create a lasting legacy that is shared with family members. As the principal designer in a small, agile team I was responsible for the design of the app, the sharing website and marketing pages. I designed the UI as well as the complete user journeys, from first-time-use to app mastery.

## Dash Audio
Dash was a suite of audio analytics tools allowing podcast creators gain better insight into their audience. I designed Jukebox, a podcast app for iPhone and iPad, the analytics dashboard, several bespoke audio apps, a consumer and enterprise website and dev docs.

## Dave's Lab
Dave’s Lab is an independent research and technology company that focuses on e-commerce and payment solutions. Among other projects I designed a global multi-language store and helped define its brand, a finance application and a property management site and dashboard. We set up several companies with our own proprietary software, one of which is #PAY, a social payment and Twitter integration for which I did the brand identity, user experience and dashboard interface design.

## Luxup
Luxup was an online member’s club / rewards programme, that wanted to bridge the widening gap between e-commerce and luxury fashion brands’ flagship store experience. I helped design user journeys for online stores in three regions, editorial pages, checkout and product pages.
