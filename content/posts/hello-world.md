Le Chameau makes boots for people who live and breathe the land. They’ve been hand making rubber boots since 1927 in the same factory in Normandy, France. With Dave’s Lab I designed their e-commerce site and worked on the company’s branding.

Le Chameau’s boots have an understated luxury to them and are worn by people who love what they do. So it only made sense to treat the website with the same attention to detail and love of life.

Here’s a high level overview of Le Chameau’s e-commerce site covering in-depth pages of their product lines categorised per purpose, company history and philosophy.
